your own citys together with your friends or just for your own. You will be able to have your own House which you
will be able to decorate with selfmade furnishings. The game also will include it's own forum-software to work
directly with the game (events will be posted automaticly in the forum and some other things are planned), there
will be a little selfmade wiki (but this is planned for later). Also there is a Support and Admin Control Panel directly
for the game planned to make the Supporting and Administration of the Game easier. In addition there will be a translation
tool which enables players or admins to translate the game and it's files easily. For this the Game will be built up
directly with Database-Based Language Control. Further Informations will come soon
